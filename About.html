                    <p>Hello, I'm Nitish Kumar Pandey, a passionate full-stack web developer based in LPU.</p>
                    <p>With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development, I specialize in creating
                        user-friendly, efficient, and scalable web applications. My journey in web development began
                        2022. Since then, I've continuously honed my skills and embraced new
                        technologies to stay ahead in this dynamic field.</p>
                    <p>My technical expertise includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Front-end technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), ReactJS, and Vue.js</li>
                        <li>Back-end technologies like Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB</li>
                        <li>Database management with MySQL and PostgreSQL</li>
                        <li>Version control using Git and GitHub</li>
                        <li>Deployment and hosting on platforms like Heroku and AWS</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work on various projects, ranging from simple static
                        websites to complex web applications. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy solving
                        challenging problems to deliver high-quality solutions that meet client requirements.</p>
                    <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects,
                        or enjoying outdoor activities like hiking and photography.</p>
                    <p>I'm currently seeking new opportunities to leverage my skills and contribute to exciting projects. Feel
